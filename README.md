# “Back in my day …”

20 years of Ruby in 5 minutes

# About this repository

This describes the modification of a program while travelling back in time
from Ruby 3.2.2 (2023) to Ruby 1.6.8 (released at the end of 2002).

Each successfully modified version is tagged.

- v3_2_2
- v3_1_2
- v3_0_1
- v2_7_1
- v2_1_0
- v1_9_3
- v1_8_7
- v1_6_8

# Running older versions

I use [asdf][asdf] and its Ruby plugin, which uses
[ruby-build][ruby-build] to build each version.

The two oldest versions required special attention:

- 1.8.7 would not build on my current machine (Ubuntu 22.04 x86_64), but worked
  in a container running Ubuntu 18.04.
- 1.6.8 will not compile under 64-bit Linux. I was able to compile it under
  a 32-bit container running Ubuntu 16.04, but `make install` did not work.
  It's still possible to run the `ruby` executable directly by giving it the
  path to the standard library.

The `Dockerfile`s for these versions are included in this repository, and can
be built with:

    docker build --tag ruby_1_8_7 docker/1_8_7
    docker build --tag ruby_1_6_8 docker/1_6_8

The provided script `run.sh` handles running the code inside the container.

See also the [all-ruby][all-ruby] project for another way to do this, that
works all the way back to Ruby 0.49.

  source on Unix-like systems." Not quite any version, but it works as far back
  as 1.8
